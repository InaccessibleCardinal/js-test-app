    Polynomials. A polynomial in ONE variable x is an expression from school math like these
                                x^2 + 4x + 2   5x^4 - 6x^2 + 7
    Where each cx^n is called a 'term' and means `c times x raised to n` -- `c` is called a 
    'coefficient', and `n` an 'exponent'. Notice that x is 1x^1 and a constant value like 7 is 7x^0.

    If we only consider polynomials p with non-negative exponents and integer coeficients, then
    the 'derivative' of p is defined by a straightforward algorithm applied to each term:
    ************************************************************************************************
    Multiply the exponent by the coeficient to get a new coeficient and decrement the exponent to 
    get the new exponent.
    ************************************************************************************************
    Example: the derivative of `3x^2 + 7x + 6` is `6x + 7 + 0`, or just `6x + 7`.
    
    Try to implement this algorithm with the 'derive' function below. One point of the exercise
    is to make some choices about what data structures might be useful for representing polynomials
    and terms. Notice that the only changing parts here are the coeficients and exponents.
